# EQuizGame
Online examination system

The E Quiz Game using PHP MySQL is a project that can be used for educational
purposes. This project will help faculty to manage the student quizzes records. Faculty can also
monitor if the student already has taken the quiz and how many students have already taken the
quiz. Faculty can create questions as much as he/she wants and answerable by choosing four
options. Quizzes are restricted to the selected students who are listed by the faculty. Each option
is randomly queued per question and so is the question per quizzes. The student can immediately
know his/her score after submitting the quiz and also can review their answer sheet to know which
question they answered wrong and right.
